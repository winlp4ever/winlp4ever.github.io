## **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

### [**Stellia.ai**](https://stellia.ai) — Paris, France
**Chief AI Officer (formerly CTO)**
*Jun 2019 – Present*

**Company Overview:**
[Stellia.ai](https://stellia.ai) (previously **ProfessorBob.ai**) builds AI-powered assistants for education, combining advanced document understanding, retrieval, and reasoning capabilities. The company successfully **raised €4 M in funding** in partnership with Innovacom and INCO Ventures — [see announcement](https://innovacom.com/2022/09/14/professorbob-ai-the-ai-based-virtual-teaching-assistant-raises-e4-million-from-innovacom-and-inco-ventures/?lang=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**Key Achievements:**
- **Architecture & Scale:** Designed and implemented the company’s **Graph-RAG question-answering platform**, processing **~2 K concurrent LLM requests** with **1–3 s TTFT**, deployed across multi-cloud (AWS + GCP + Scaleway).
- **Performance & Quality:** Achieved **+5–10 pp accuracy improvement** over baseline RAG pipelines (LangChain/OpenAI), with better context retention and reasoning depth.
- **Infrastructure & Reliability:** Built distributed AI infrastructure combining **vector and hybrid search** (Elasticsearch, Qdrant, Milvus) with robust orchestration using **Prefect** and **Kubernetes**.
- **Core Systems Development:**
  - Engineered a document-ingestion and parsing stack preserving layout, tables, and hierarchy using [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU), and [Marker](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker).
  - Developed an agentic AI assistant integrating retrieval, reasoning, and tool-usage (web search, code execution, API calls) with [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) and [SmolAgents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents).
- **Leadership:** Managed and mentored **7 AI engineers and data scientists** from top French programs (École Polytechnique, ENS, Paris-Saclay).
- **Collaboration:** Co-developed a **math reasoning solver** for the University of Arizona, integrated into their e-learning platform.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Go, TypeScript, React, Elasticsearch, Qdrant, Milvus, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS / GCP / Scaleway.
