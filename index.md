## **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

### [**Stellia.ai**](https://stellia.ai) — Paris, France
**Chief AI Officer (formerly CTO)**
*Jun 2019 – Present*

**Company Overview:**
[Stellia.ai](https://stellia.ai) builds AI-powered assistants for education, combining advanced document understanding, retrieval and reasoning capabilities. The company successfully **raised €4 M in funding** in partnership with Innovacom and INCO Ventures — [see announcement](https://innovacom.com/2022/09/14/professorbob-ai-the-ai-based-virtual-teaching-assistant-raises-e4-million-from-innovacom-and-inco-ventures/?lang=en&utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**Key Achievements:**
- **Team Leadership:** Managed and mentored a team of 7 data scientists and engineers from leading French institutions (École Polytechnique, ENS, Paris-Saclay).
- **AI System Design:** Architected and implemented the company’s core **Graph-RAG system**, handling the full AI pipeline from document ingestion to reasoning-based question answering.
- **Infrastructure:** Designed and deployed a multi-cloud AI infrastructure across AWS, GCP and Scaleway — including distributed storage (S3, RDS, Postgres), compute orchestration, and model serving with Docker & Kubernetes.
- **Scalability & Reliability:** Built high-throughput ML APIs capable of handling thousands of concurrent requests with efficient async I/O, load-balancing and caching mechanisms.
- **Core Product Development:**
  - Implemented an end-to-end graph-based hybrid retrieval system, integrating semantic (vector) and keyword search with Elasticsearch, Qdrant and Milvus.
  - Engineered the document ingestion and parsing pipeline preserving layout, tables and hierarchy (using [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract), [MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU), [Marker](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker)).
  - Developed an agentic AI assistant system combining retrieval, reasoning and tool-usage (web search, code execution, external APIs) built with frameworks like [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) and [SmolAgents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents).
- **Research & Model Work:** Benchmarked and fine-tuned LLMs and text-embedding models for domain-specific tasks (Q&A, exercise generation, graph reasoning).
- **Collaboration:** Developed a mathematical reasoning solver for the University of Arizona, integrated into their learning platform.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Go, TypeScript, React, Elasticsearch, Qdrant, Milvus, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS / GCP / Scaleway.
